## helps wanted

* I got a very important help on [my StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61931503/why-a-pending-intent-does-not-start-an-activity-when-called-form-a-services-not/61933204#61933204)
* I also followed that [Android Developpers Video](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/channels); 

## Android 19 versus Android 29:
* Why on Android19 I still get the icon of the main application?
* Why on Android 19 getIntent().getExtras() does return null
  * On Android 29 I get the bundle not null and from that bundle 
the right Movement value (serializable object)
